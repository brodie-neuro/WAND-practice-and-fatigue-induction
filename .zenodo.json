    "description": "WAND (Working-memory Adaptive-fatigue with N-back Difficulty) is an open-source PsychoPy software suite for cognitive fatigue research. Key features include: (1) a GUI launcher for experiment configuration, (2) adaptive N-back tasks (Sequential, Spatial, Dual) with real-time difficulty adjustment, (3) a practice calibration protocol with plateau detection to establish stable baselines, (4) a ~65-minute fatigue induction protocol with timing compression and mini-distractors, (5) comprehensive Signal Detection Theory metrics (d', A', criterion), (6) EEG trigger support, and (7) pip-installable with console entry points. The suite enables researchers to systematically induce and measure active cognitive fatigue while maintaining participant engagement through adaptive difficulty.",
